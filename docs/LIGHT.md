# SmartIR Light

Find your device's brand code [here](LIGHT_CODES.md) and add the number in the `device_code` field. If your device is not supported, you will need to learn your own IR codes and place them in the Json file in `smartir/custom_codes/light` subfolder. Please refer to [this guide](CODES_SYNTAX.md) to find a way how to do it. Once you have working device file please do not forgot to submit Pull Request so it could be inherited to this project for other users.

| `power_sensor_restore_state` | boolean | optional | If `true` than in case power sensor will report to HA that device is `on` without HA actually switching it `on `(device was switched on by remote, of device cycled, etc.), than HA will report last assumed state and attributes at the time when the device was `on` managed by HA. If set to `false` when device will be reported as `on` by the power sensors all device attributes will be reported as `UNKNOWN`. Default is `true`. |

      zha_command: 2
      zha_command_type: "server"
    power_sensor: binary_sensor.bedroom_light_power
```

## Light device files

As well as the command mappings, the light device config supports two lists:
`brightness` and `color_temperature`. These should be sorted lists
from lower to higher values of brightness on a scale of 1 to 255, and
color temperature in Kelvin (normally from 2700 to 6500). Supported
commands are `on` `off`, `brighten`, `dim`, `warmer`, `colder` and `night`.
If `night` is configured, it is implemented as a special brightness step that
can be selected by setting a brightness of 1 (such lights usually have a
separate small and dim nightlight bulb inside the fixture).
